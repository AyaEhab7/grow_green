# Grow Green

## Project Description 

The project is a Nursery Management Platform aimed at tracking the care and condition of plants across three types of nurseries (tree nurseries, vegetable nurseries, and ornamental nurseries). Farmers will be able to update plant information such as irrigation status, fertilization status, and pest control. These updates will be tracked over time in a table. On the other hand, managers will have the ability to view updates without making modifications, and they can manage product requests made by farmers for plant care. Farmers can submit product requests, which managers can approve or reject.

## User Stories

### Farmer

- As a Farmer, I want to select the irrigation status (e.g., Watered, Needs Watering, Overwatered) for each plant, so I can keep track of the plant’s irrigation status.

- As a Farmer, I want to update the fertilization status and pest control status for each plant, so I can properly care for the plants.

- As a Farmer, I want to see a table of previous updates for each plant, including date and time, so I can track all the changes made over time.

- As a Farmer, I want to set the final condition of the plant (Green, Yellow, Red) and write a note explaining why I chose that condition, so I can document the plant’s current state.

- As a Farmer, I want to submit product requests for plant care supplies, so I can get the necessary products for plant care.

### Manager

- As a Manager, I want to view all the updates made by farmers without the ability to edit them, so I can track plant conditions and care for progress.

- As a Manager, I want to view all product requests submitted by farmers, so I can approve or reject these requests based on inventory and need.

### Store Controller

- As a Store Controller, I want to add new products to the inventory, including details such as name, description, price, quantity, and category, so that farmers can access a complete and up-to-date list of available products.

- As a Store Controller, I want to update existing product information (price, description, stock quantity) so that the product details remain accurate and reflect current availability.

- As a Store Controller, I want to delete products that are no longer available from the inventory, ensuring that farmers cannot request products that are out of stock or discontinued.

- As a Store Controller, I want to view a list of all available products, displaying essential details like name, price, and stock status, so that I can manage and monitor the product inventory efficiently.
